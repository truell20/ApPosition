# MyHM

**MyHM is still under development.** 

MyHM is a scheduling and location app for the Horace Mann School. MyHM uses the Ionic Framework and is written in HTML5 and AngularJS. On the backend, the app utilizes a RESTful API written in PHP using a MYSQL database running on an Apache Server.

Users see their schedule, can setup meetings with teachers and peers, can share their current location, and can see if friends are free.

MyHM was made by [Michael Truell](https://github.com/truell20) and [Josh Gruenstein](https://github.com/joshuagruenstein).
